### Couples Wallpaper Project

This project is based off of a piece of art I commissioned from an artist named [Maukeiv](https://twitter.com/Maukeiv), I really loved how it came out, and wanted to "bring it to life" with some JS/CSS.

This project accomplishes that goal by animating squares behind a top layer, and behind that top layer rendering a gradiant to act as a background as shown below:
