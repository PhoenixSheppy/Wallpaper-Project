### Couples Wallpaper Project

This project is based off of a piece of art I commissioned from an artist named [Maukeiv](https://twitter.com/Maukeiv), I really loved how it came out, and wanted to "bring it to life" with some JS/CSS.

This project accomplishes that goal by animating squares mid-layer between a background and foreground element like shown below:

All credit for the artwork goes to Maukeiv, go give him a look [here](https://twitter.com/Maukeiv) if you're interested in his work.
